var myString;
myString = "hello world!";
console.log(myString); // this outputs to console
document.write(myString) // outputs to html (not really how it is done but it is a way to see what we are doing in class)

can also put in html elements into it as well

document.write("<b>" + myString + "</b>");

-DOM elements- (not here yet but can start doing more interesting things with our websites)

printing to the console and document write is for debugging purpose.


var a = 5;
console.log(typeof(a)); //can use to check data type

var result1, result2, result3;
var result1 = !false
var result2 = !false

console.log (result3);

do all caps in my code
html and css use hyphens use camel case in JavaScript
